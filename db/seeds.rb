  {name: "Cannondale SYNAPSE ALLOY DISC Rival Adventure Roadbike 2015 - GRN", description: "<b> Even more stamina!</b> \r\nWhether you're on group rides or take the detour on the daily commute with the little bit of extra comfort, the Synapse Alloy Disc is made to enjoy kilometers. At the same time it is the first Cannondale road bike equipped with disc brakes, which provide strong braking power and perpetual control. \r\nThe Synapse Endurance Geometry meets with a slightly higher head tube, a slightly longer wheelbase and a slightly shallower steering angle, the ideal balance between pure racing upright position and comfort.\r\n240 km routes across hell? The Synapse is the ultimate partner for an unprecedented journey! \r\n\r\nThe craftsmanship that Cannondale put into their frames is unrivaled. The Optimized Alloy Frame with its true smooth welds help to create a stronger, stiffer frameset.\r\nThe so-called SAVE PLUS aluminium allows the rear by flattening and butting the chainstays and seatstays to vertical flex and absorb the bumps and vibrations of the road. At the same time a high lateral rigidity for optimal power transfer and cornering ability is maintained.\r\nThe fork with carbon blades and integrated SAVE components allow an extra comfort and precise handling. In addition, the frame provides the ability to mount fenders. \r\n\r\nCompletely new SRAM Rival 22 components guarantee smooth and durable shifting and braking performance over years. And with fenders in the frame colour the \"ride\" remains an experience even in the rain. \r\n\r\nWhy disc brakes on a road bike?\r\nNo rim wear (the wheelset will last longer)\r\nNo pres­sure changes inside the tire due to temperature change while braking\r\nSame brak­ing per­for­mance in any whether condition\r\nLess rotat­ing iner­tia (rim weight sav­ing)\r\nCan run even on a non-straight rim (i.e. spoke failure)\r\nHistory of MTB already tells the way to go...\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not sell bikes without consultation.
